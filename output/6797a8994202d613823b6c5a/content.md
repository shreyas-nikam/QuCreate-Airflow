# PE Ratio
 
### Introduction to P/E and PEG Ratios

* P/E Ratio: Price-to-Earnings ratio, a measure of a company's current share price relative to its per-share earnings.
* PEG Ratio: Price/Earnings to Growth ratio, a valuation metric for determining the relative trade-off between the price of a stock, the earnings generated per share, and the company's expected growth.
* Importance: Both ratios are crucial in financial analysis for assessing a company's valuation and growth potential.

### Understanding the P/E Ratio

* The Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio is a key financial metric used to evaluate a company's stock price relative to its earnings.
* It reflects market expectations about a company's future growth and profitability.
* A high P/E ratio may indicate high growth expectations, while a low P/E ratio might suggest undervaluation or low growth prospects.
* Limitations include its inability to account for differences in growth rates and the impact of external factors on earnings.
* P/E ratios should be used in conjunction with other metrics for a comprehensive analysis.

### The Role of ROIC in P/E Ratios

* ROIC determines how much profit is available for distribution to shareholders.
* Higher ROIC allows for a higher distribution rate at any given growth level.
* Companies with higher ROIC have higher P/E ratios due to better profit distribution potential.

### The PEG Ratio Explained

* PEG Ratio is the Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio divided by the earnings growth rate.
* It is used to determine a stock's value while considering the company's earnings growth.
* A PEG ratio of 1 suggests that the stock is fairly valued, above 1 may indicate overvaluation, and below 1 may suggest undervaluation.

### Analyzing Fair Value P/E Ratios

* Fair Value P/E ratios are calculated based on the ROIC-Cost of Capital spread.
* A positive spread indicates a higher P/E ratio, reflecting better investment returns.
* A negative spread suggests a lower P/E ratio, indicating potential value loss.
* The table illustrates how varying spreads affect P/E ratios across different growth rates.
* Understanding these ratios helps in assessing whether a stock is fairly valued.
