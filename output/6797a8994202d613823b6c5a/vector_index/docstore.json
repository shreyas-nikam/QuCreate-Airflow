Bleiberg\nManaging Director, Portfolio Manager\nIn any market system, prices contain information. The problem is, it\u2019s not always easy to\nfigure out what that information is. When frost blankets Florida\u2019s orange groves in winter,\nit is clear why the price of orange juice goes up \u2014 the frost reduces the orange supply.\nBut when the price of a stock goes up, it is rarely easy to draw such an obvious connection\nbetween a specific piece of information and the change in price. We are left to fall back on\nmodels about which kinds of information matter to market participants, who ultimately\ndetermine the price of a stock through their trading with one another.\nWilliam W. Priest, CFA\nChief Executive Officer, Co-Chief\nInvestment Officer & Portfolio Manager\nIn this paper, we are going to address two issues. In Part 1, we will explore the theory\nbehind the most plausible model of what information a stock price contains \u2014 the\ndiscounted cash flow (DCF) model. Most readers are no doubt familiar with the model,\nso our purpose is not to offer an initial introduction. Rather, we want to focus on the\nunderappreciated role that return on invested capital (ROIC) plays in the model, through\nthe way it determines how much of a company\u2019s profit is available to be distributed to\nshareholders. We will show that there is an inevitable trade-off between two key variables\nwithin the DCF model, and that ROIC is the key to understanding which side wins out in\nthat trade-off. And just as ROIC plays a behind-the-scenes role in determining prices, so it\nplays the same role in driving price/earnings (P/E) ratios. We will find that the P/E ratio does\nnot tell us what most people think it does, nor does its offshoot, the P/E to growth (PEG)\nratio. We will move on in Part 2 to see how we can use what we have learned about the DCF\nmodel to deconstruct P/E ratios in the real world to better understand what they do tell us.\nPART 1: THEORY\nThe Variables That Determine a Company\u2019s Worth\nIn our view, the most sensible way to determine what a business is worth is to perform\nsome variation of a discounted cash flow analysis: estimate what cash flows a company will\nthrow off to its owners over time, and then discount those cash flows back to their present\nvalue. Why do we believe this is the best model? For two related reasons: first, if you were\ngoing to put up the money to buy a business in full, the DCF approach captures how you\nwould put a price on the business: if I buy this, what are the cash flows it will throw off to\nme, the owner, over time, and what are those cash flows worth in today\u2019s dollars? Indeed,\nthis is how private equity firms generally value a business. Second, for publicly traded\nbusinesses there is an arbitrage opportunity if the stock price deviates too far from what a\nDCF analysis says the company is worth. If the price is well below what the DCF model says\n 1",
