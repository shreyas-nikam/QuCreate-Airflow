    "term": "adversarial example",
    "extended_definition": "- An adversarial example is a carefully modified test input aimed at misleading machine learning models.\n- It typically involves adding small, often imperceptible perturbations to an input that result in a model misclassifying it or behaving unexpectedly.\n- Adversarial examples highlight the vulnerability of machine learning models, specifically deep learning models, to subtle data changes that can destabilize model predictions.\n- In the broader context, adversarial examples pose significant threats to system security, particularly in areas like autonomous vehicles, facial recognition, and cybersecurity, where machine learning algorithms are extensively employed.\n- These examples challenge assumptions about model robustness and call for improved defense mechanisms to ensure safe deployment in critical systems.\n- Researchers and security professionals constantly work towards creating defenses against such adversarial attacks through various methods including adversarial training, defensive distillation, and input preprocessing.",
    "scenario": {
      "description": "In a large financial institution, machine learning algorithms are used for fraud detection. Adversaries craft adversarial examples by slightly altering transaction data to deceive the fraud detection model into classifying fraudulent transactions as legitimate.\n- The attack was identified when the organization noticed an unexpected increase in successful fraudulent activities and investigated the anomaly.\n- During the identification phase, audit logs showed small but consistent changes in transaction features that were not typical, triggering further scrutiny.\n- The organization responded by implementing stricter monitoring and installing anomaly detection systems to flag similar patterns in the future, effectively controlling the situation. \n- To mitigate such risks in the future, the institution updated the fraud detection model to include adversarial training, thus improving its robustness against such cleverly disguised attacks. Also, regular red-teaming exercises were adopted to simulate adversarial attacks and assess model resilience.",
      "impact_on_organization": "The organization faced financial losses due to undetected fraudulent transactions, which also led to a loss of customer trust. The incident highlighted potential vulnerabilities in their fraud detection systems.",
      "identification": "The attack was identified through anomaly detection systems and investigation of audit logs that showed unusual transaction patterns.",
      "control": "The bank implemented stricter monitoring protocols and anomaly detection measures to catch similar attacks earlier.",
      "mitigation": "Adversarial training was incorporated into the fraud detection model. Regular red-team exercises were also scheduled to test and improve model defenses against adversarial attacks."
